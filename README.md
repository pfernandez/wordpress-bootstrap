WP BOOTSTRAP
===================

[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) in WordPress theme form. You can view it live on the [example site](base.artsdigital.co).


GETTING STARTED
_______________

To get started, open Terminal or a command prompt and run:

	cd path/to/wp-content/themes
	git clone https://github.com/pfernandez/wordpress-bootstrap.git
	npm install
	grunt dev

FEATURES
________

This is a (fairly heavily) modified fork of the [original project](https://github.com/320press/wordpress-bootstrap) by 320press. It features full-width page templates and a more minimal default Bootstrap configuration, omitting the JS, box shadows and rounded corners. It works well either as a parent theme or as starter theme to build from.

JS files can be added on an as-needed basis by either uncommenting them in `Gruntfile.js` and recompiling, or by enqueuing them in a child theme's `functions.php` file.

Multi-Lingual
_____________

WP-Bootstrap is translated in 7 languages - Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Swedish and German. 

Page Templates
______________

We’ve packaged four different page templates into this theme.

    - Home page
    - Default page with right sidebar
    - Full width page

Shortcodes
__________

We’ve built in some shortcodes so you can easily add UI elements found in Bootstrap.

Sidebars
________

There is one sidebar, which appears on default pages. Add widgets to it.

CONTRIBUTE!
___________

This project would not exist in its current state today were it not for lots of generous folks who have contributed to it. Thank you! 

The philosophy is to keep the project minimal, up to date, and bug-free. If you'd like to commit please submit a pull request and I will do my best to merge appropriately.
