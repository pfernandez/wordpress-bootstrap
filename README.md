WP BOOTSTRAP
===================

[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) in WordPress theme form.


GETTING STARTED
_______________

To get started, open Terminal or a command prompt and run:

	cd path/to/wp-content/themes
	git clone https://github.com/pfernandez/wordpress-bootstrap.git

FEATURES
________

This is a fork of the [original project](https://github.com/320press/wordpress-bootstrap) by 320press. It features full-width page templates and a more minimal default Bootstrap configuration, leaving out all but the bare JS essentials. It works well either as a parent theme or as starter theme to build from.

Grunt and NPM features have been removed outside of the `bower_components` directory. Dependencies are handled exclusively through Bower to make it simple to drop in a custom Bootstrap intallation.

Multi-Lingual
_____________

WP-Bootstrap is translated in 7 languages - Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Swedish and German. 

Page Templates
______________

We’ve packaged four different page templates into this theme.

    - Home page
    - Default page with right sidebar
    - Full width wide page
    - Full width narrow page

Shortcodes
__________

We’ve built in some shortcodes so you can easily add UI elements found in Bootstrap.

Sidebars
________

There is one sidebar, which appears on default pages. Add widgets to it.

CONTRIBUTE!
___________

This project would not exist in its current state today were it not for lots of generous folks who have contributed to it. Thank you! 

The philosophy is to keep the project minimal, up to date, and bug-free. If you'd like to commit please submit a pull request and I will do my best to merge appropriately.
